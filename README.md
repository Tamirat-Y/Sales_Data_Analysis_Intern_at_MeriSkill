# Sales Data Analysis Intern Project at MeriSkill
As part of a Data Analyst internship at MeriSkill, a comprehensive sales data analysis was conducted to uncover actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making. The dataset, containing over 185,000 records, was cleaned, structured, and analyzed using Python and data visualization tools. Key business questions were addressed, including identifying peak sales months, top-performing cities, optimal advertising hours, frequently bundled products, and best-selling items. It was revealed that October to December were the highest sales months, while San Francisco led in total revenue. Peak sales hours were found between late morning and evening, offering strategic timing for digital ads. AAA Batteries (4-pack) emerged as the top-selling product, highlighting the impact of low-cost, high-demand items. These findings were translated into strategic recommendations such as bundling products, targeting peak hours for promotions, and aligning marketing with seasonal trends to optimize revenue and customer engagement.

## **Conclusion and Insights**

***The sales dataset initially contained 186,850 rows and 6 columns. After thorough cleaning and transformation, the final structured dataset consisted of 185,950 rows and 12 columns, enabling more detailed and meaningful analysis.***

**Key insights derived from the analysis include:**

* Peak Sales Months:
> The months of October, November, and December showed significantly higher sales volumes. This trend aligns with the seasonal demand surge due to holiday shopping events such as Black Friday and Christmas.

* Lowest Sales Month:
> January recorded the lowest sales, likely due to post-holiday financial recovery among customers and reduced consumer spending.

* Top and Bottom Performing Cities:

> San Francisco emerged as the city with the highest sales, indicating a strong customer base or high purchasing power.

> Austin, on the other hand, recorded the lowest sales, suggesting either lower demand or fewer promotional activities.

* Peak Sales Hours:

> Sales peaked during 10:30 AM – 1:00 PM and 6:00 PM – 8:00 PM.

>> These time slots are ideal for scheduling digital ads and promotional displays to maximize visibility and conversion.

* Frequently Bought Together:
> The combination of Google Phone and Wired Headphones was commonly purchased together, suggesting bundling opportunities or cross-promotion strategies.

* Top-Selling Product:
> AAA Batteries (4-pack) were the most frequently sold item. The likely reason is their low unit price, making them a common add-on or impulse purchase.

* Price vs Quantity Relationship:
> An inverse moderate correlation was observed between Quantity Ordered and Mean Prices, indicating that lower-priced items tend to be ordered in larger quantities.


##  **Recommendations**

Based on these insights, I recommend the following strategies for business optimization:

* **Align promotions with seasonal trends**:
   > Plan major campaigns around **October to December** when consumer spending is highest. Boost discounts and ad reach during these months.

* **Target peak hours for ads**:
   > Launch ads and email promotions between **10:30 AM – 1 PM** and **6 PM – 8 PM** to increase visibility during high-conversion windows.

* **Leverage product bundling**:
   > Promote combo deals using popular pairings like smartphones with charging cables or headphones to drive upselling.

* **Focus on volume drivers**:
   > Continue pushing **low-cost, fast-moving** items like batteries and cables through pricing tactics and online visibility.

* **Invest in high-performing regions**:
   > Allocate more inventory and marketing spend to **cities like San Francisco, LA, and NYC**, while exploring reasons behind **Austin’s low sales**.

* **Use price sensitivity data**:
   > Since lower prices are linked with higher sales, experiment with **tiered pricing**, discounts, and bundles to boost conversion rates for mid-range and premium products.
